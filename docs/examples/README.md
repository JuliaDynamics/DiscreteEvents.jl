# Example programs

- `greeting.jl`: an initial example
- `tabletennis.jl`: a simple table tennis simulation
- `channel[1-4].jl`: the four channel examples show the same problem expressed in four different modeling approaches. See the [documentation](https://pbayer.github.io/Simulate.jl/dev/approach/).

Other examples are from an earlier version of `PFlow` and have yet to be adapted.
