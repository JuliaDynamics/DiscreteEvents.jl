# DiscreteEvents

A Julia package for **discrete event generation and simulation**.

**Note:** This package has been renamed and its code and examples have been updated to upcoming `v0.3`. The registered package is [`Simulate`](https://github.com/pbayer/DiscreteEvents.jl/tree/v0.2.0)

`DiscreteEvents` introduces a *clock* and allows to schedule arbitrary functions or expressions as *actions* on the clock's timeline. It provides simple, yet powerful ways to model and simulate discrete event systems (DES).
