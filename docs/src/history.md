# Version history

## v0.2.0 (development)
- functions and macros for defining conditions
- conditional `wait!(cond)`
- conditional events with `event!(sim, ex, cond)` are executed when the conditions are met,
- `event!` can be called without the first clock argument, it then goes to `ùê∂`,
- `event!` takes an expression or a SimFunction or a tuple or an array of them,
- introduced aliases: `SF` for `SimFunction` and `SP` for `SimProcess`
- introduced process-based simulation with `SimProcess` and `process!`,
- extensive documentation,
- more examples,
