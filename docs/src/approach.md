### Approaches to modeling and simulation

I want to develop `Simulate.jl` to support four major approaches to modeling and simulation of discrete event systems (DES):

- [x] **event based**: events occur in time and trigger actions, which may
cause further events …
- [x] **activity based**: activities occur in time and cause other activities …
- [x] **state based**: events occur in time and trigger actions of entities (e.g. state machines) depending on their current state, those actions may cause further events …
- [ ] **process based**: entities in a DES are modeled as processes waiting for
events and then acting according to the event and their current state …

With the current main two simulation hooks of `Simulate.jl`: `event!` and `SimFunction` the first three approaches are supported. Therefore the next step will be to integrate a process based modeling and simulation approach. Then all four approaches can be combined.
