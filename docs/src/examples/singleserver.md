### Single server

This example is from Choi, Kang: Modeling and Simulation of Discrete-Event Systems, p. 18. It describes a single server system. The event graph given is:

![single server](../images/sserver.svg)

1. Initially there are no jobs in the queue ``Q`` and the machine ``M`` is idle.
2. Jobs arrive with an inter-arrival-time ``t_a``and are added to ``Q``.
3. If ``M`` is idle, it loads a job, changes to busy and executes the job with service time ``t_s``.
4. After that it changes to idle and, if ``Q`` is not empty, it loads the next job.

### Implementing it

We use this simple example for illustration of how it can be modeled, simulated and analyzed using `Sim.jl`. First we have to import the necessary modules:

```julia
using Simulate, Random, Distributions, DataFrames, Plots, LaTeXStrings
pyplot()
```

We have to define some data structures, variables and a function for collecting stats:

```julia
abstract type MState end

struct Idle <: MState end
struct Busy <: MState end

mutable struct Job
    no::Int64
    ts::Float64
    t1::Float64
    t2::Float64
    t3::Float64
end

mutable struct Machine
    state::MState
    job
end

Q = Job[]   # input queue
S = Job[]   # stock
M = Machine(Idle(), 0)
df = DataFrame(time = Float64[], buffer=Int[], machine=Int[], finished=Int[])
count = 1
printing = true

stats() = push!(df, (œÑ(), length(Q), M.state == Busy() ? 1 : 0, length(S)))
```

We can model our system **activity-based** und therefore implement functions for the three main activities (arrive, load, unload), which call each other during simulation.

We use the arrival-function for modeling arrival rate ``t_a`` with an Erlang and service time ``t_s`` with a Normal distribution. We determine the capacity of the server with a ``c`` variable such that ``c > 1`` gives us overcapacity and ``c = 1`` means that mean service time equals mean arrival rate ``\bar{t_s} = \bar{t_a}``.

```julia
function arrive(Œº, œÉ, c)
    @assert Œº ‚â• 1 "Œº must be ‚â• 1"
    ts = rand(Normal(Œº, œÉ))/c
    job = Job(count, ts, œÑ(), 0, 0)
    global count += 1
    push!(Q, job)
    ta = rand(Erlang())*Œº
    event!(ùê∂, SimFunction(arrive, Œº, œÉ, c), after, ta)  # we schedule the next arrival
    printing ? println(œÑ(), ": job $(job.no) has arrived") : nothing # œÑ() is the current time
    if M.state == Idle()
        load()
    else
        stats()
    end
end

function load()
    M.state = Busy()
    M.job = popfirst!(Q)
    M.job.t2 = œÑ()
    event!(ùê∂, SimFunction(unload), after, M.job.ts)  # we schedule the unload
    printing ? println(œÑ(), ": job $(M.job.no) has been loaded") : nothing
    stats()
end

function unload()
    M.state = Idle()
    M.job.t3 = œÑ()
    push!(S, M.job)
    printing ? println(œÑ(), ": job $(M.job.no) has been finished") : nothing
    stats()
    M.job = 0
    if !isempty(Q)
        load()
    end
end
```

We want to collect `stats()` at a sample rate of 0.1:

```julia
sample_time!(ùê∂, 0.1)  # we determine the sample rate
Sim.sample!(ùê∂, SimFunction(stats));  # we register stats() as sampling function
```

We assume now that the capacity equals the arrivals and provide no overcapacity.  Therefore  we start with one arrival and ``\mu = 5``, ``\sigma = 1/5`` and ``c = 1`` and let our system run for 30 minutes (let's assume our time unit be minutes):

```julia
Random.seed!(2019)
arrive(5, 1/5, 1)  # we schedule the first event
run!(ùê∂, 30)        # and run the simulation
```

This will give us as output:

```julia
0: job 1 has arrived
0: job 1 has been loaded
4.947453062901819: job 1 has been finished
8.515206032139384: job 2 has arrived
8.515206032139384: job 2 has been loaded

26.84742108339802: job 13 has arrived
28.18186102251928: job 5 has been finished
28.18186102251928: job 6 has been loaded
"run! finished with 17 events, simulation time: 30.0"
```

Using our collected data, we can plot the simulation model trajectory:

```julia
function trajectory_plot()
    p1 = plot(df.time, df.buffer, ylabel="buffer", fill=(0,0.1,:blue))
    p2 = plot(df.time, df.machine, ylabel="machine", fill=(0,0.1,:blue))
    p3 = plot(df.time, df.finished, xlabel="time [min]", ylabel="stock", fill=(0,0.1,:blue))
    plot(p1,p2,p3, layout=(3,1), legend=false)
end
trajectory_plot()
```

![trajectory plot 1](../images/sserver1.png)

It seems that the queue increases over time. Thus we are interested in the behaviour of our model over a longer time. Therefore we switch off printing and continue the simulation for further 970 "minutes".

```julia
printing = false
run!(ùê∂, 970)        # we continue the simulation
trajectory_plot()
```

![trajectory plot 2](../images/sserver2.png)

It seems that buffer size is increasing ever more over time. In the plot now machine load and stock aren't very instructive, so let's compare lead time ``W`` and number of jobs in the system ``L = \text{buffer_size} + \text{machine_load}``:

```julia
function WvsL() # get more instructive info from simulation run
    t = [j.t1 for j ‚àà S]
    W = [j.t3 - j.t1 for j ‚àà S]
    ts = [j.t3 - j.t2 for j ‚àà S]
    subs = [i ‚àà t for i ‚àà df.time]
    L = (df.buffer + df.machine)[subs]
    l = df.machine[subs]
    DataFrame(time=t, load=l, W=W, L=L, ts=ts)
end
d = WvsL()
plot(d.time, d.W, label="W [min]", xlabel="time [min]", lw=2, legend=:topleft, title="L and W over time")
plot!(d.time, d.L, label="L [jobs]", lw=2)
```

![L and W over time](../images/sserver3.png)

Lead time ``W`` and unfinished jobs ``L`` are clearly increasing, the system is not stationary and gets jammed over time. Let's collect some stats:

```julia
collect_stats() =
    (Lm = mean(d.L), Wm = mean(d.W), Œ∑ = mean(df.machine), tsm = mean(d.ts))
collect_stats()
(Lm = 16.21105527638191, Wm = 78.8196419189297, Œ∑ = 0.9778719397363466, tsm = 5.003771234356064)
```

Server load of ``\overline{Œ∑} ‚âà 98\%`` is great, but the mean queue length ``\overline{L}`` of ``16`` and mean lead time ``\overline{W} ‚âà 79`` min are way too long for a service time of ``t_s ‚âà 5`` min. So let's analyze the dependency of mean queue length ``\overline{L}`` on server capacity ``c``. For that we can manipulate the server capacity in the arrival function and collect the results in a table:

```julia
df1 = DataFrame(c=Float64[], Lm=Float64[], Wm=Float64[], Œ∑=Float64[], tsm=Float64[])
for c ‚àà collect(0.97:0.01:1.7)
    global Q = Job[]   # input queue
    global S = Job[]   # stock
    global M = Machine(Idle(), 0)
    global df = DataFrame(time = Float64[], buffer=Int[], machine=Int[], finished=Int[])
    global count = 1

    reset!(ùê∂)                            # reset ùê∂
    sample_time!(ùê∂, 1)                   # set sample rate to 1
    Sim.sample!(ùê∂, SimFunction(stats))   # register the stats() function for sampling

    Random.seed!(2019)
    arrive(5, 1/5, c)
    run!(ùê∂, 1000)                        # run another simulation for 1000 "min"
    global d = WvsL()
    s = collect_stats()
    push!(df1, (c, s.Lm, s.Wm, s.Œ∑, s.tsm))
end
```

We can look at it in a scatter plot:

```julia
scatter(df1.c, df1.Wm, title=L"\overline{W}"*" and "*L"\overline{L}"*" over server capacity",
    xlabel="server capacity", marker = (:o, 3, 0.4, :blue), label=L"\overline{W}"*" [min]")
scatter!(df1.c, df1.Lm, marker = (:x, 4), label=L"\overline{L}"*" [jobs]")
```

![W and L over server capacity](../images/sserver4.png)

We need to increase server capacity much in order to avoid long queues and waiting times.

### How about Little's law?

``\overline{W}`` and ``\overline{L}`` seem to be proportional. This is stated by [Little's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law):

```math
\begin{equation}
L = \lambda\times W
\end{equation}
```
for stationary systems with ``\lambda`` = arrival rate. In our case ``\lambda = t_a = 5``. Let's look at it:

```julia
scatter(df1.Lm, df1.Wm, xlabel=L"\overline{L}"*" [jobs]", ylabel=L"\overline{W}"*" [min]",
    marker = (:o, 4, 0.4, :blue), label="data", title="Little's law", legend=:topleft)
plot!(df1.Lm, df1.Lm*5, label="theory "*L"(\overline{L}\times 5)")
```

![Little's law](../images/sserver5.png)

Data seems not quite to fit theory. Reason is that the system is not stationary. But for a first approach, Little's law seems not to be a bad one. In order to analyze stability and [stationarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process) and to improve, we could refine our analysis by taking only the second half of the simulation data or by doing more simulation runs and having some more fun with `Sim.jl` ...
