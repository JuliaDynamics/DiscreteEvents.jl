# Overview

The examples are intended to show how `Simulate.jl` can be used and how different approaches to modeling and simulation can be employed and combined with it.

- [**Two guys meet**](greeting.md): an introductory example,
- [**Table tennis**](singleserver.md): a state-based simulation,
- [**Single server**](tabletennis.md): an activity-based simulation of a single server,
- [**Post office**](postoffice/postoffice.md): a process-based simulation of a post-office,
- [**Goldratt's dice game**](dicegame/dicegame.md): a simulation of assembly lines,
  illustrating what can be done with multiple simulations and parameter variation on
  parallel threads,
- [**House heating**](house_heating/house_heating.md): a simulation of a hybrid system,
  combining all three schemes: events, continuous sampling and processes.
