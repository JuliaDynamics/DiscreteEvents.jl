# Troubleshooting

## Problems

### Process startup

Under some environments (e.g. Jupyter) between starting processes with `process!` and running a simulation a little sleep, e.g. `sleep!(0.1)` is needed before running a simulation with `run!` to ensure that all started processes have enqueued for clock events.

### A SimProcess fails

If `c` is your clock, you get the list of all running processes with `c.processes`. You  then look at the failed process with `c.processes[id].task`. This gives you the stack trace of the failed process, e.g.

```julia
julia> ùê∂.processes
Dict{Any,SimProcess} with 2 entries:
  2 => SimProcess(2, Task (failed) @0x000000010e467850, Idle(), clerk, Channel{‚Ä¶
  1 => SimProcess(1, Task (failed) @0x000000010e467cd0, Idle(), people, Channel‚Ä¶
julia> ùê∂.processes[1].task
Task (failed) @0x000000010e467cd0
