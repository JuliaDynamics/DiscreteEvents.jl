    "as [requested by zhangliye](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/simulate-v0-2-0-a-julia-package-for-discrete-event-simulation/31822/9).  Zhangliye pointed out that there is no explanation of how to implement shared resources in `Simulate.jl`. The [`SimPy example`](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/shared_resources.html) cited by him simulates five cars, sharing a battery charging station with two charging points.\n",
